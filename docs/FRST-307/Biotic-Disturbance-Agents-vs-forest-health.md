# Biotic Disturance Agents VS Forest Health
## Outline
* Forest disturbances abiotic versus biotic
* "Forest health" in the headlines
* Forest health: what it really means


"Healthy" forests require change or [[FRST-307/disturbance]]
- Insects and diseases have much greater impacts than wildfire
- Disturbance annually affects many thousands of hectares
- High public profile
	- "Forest Health"

## Biotic disturbances and "forest health" in the news:
- the emerald ash borer
- Forest diseases in the news: Dutch elm disease
- Sirex Wood Wasp
	- Lays eggs and a packet of fungi and enzymes in sapwood
- Sudden oak death
	- Fungi pathogen
- Spruce beetle
	- Massive impacts to Alaska nad the Yukon
- Chestnut Blight
	- Geneticists have been trying to fix this issue by introducing genes from Asian Chestnut
- Mountain Pine Beetle


## Forest health: A closer look
- One of the most widely used terms in ecosystem management
- Often in the news
- Associated with:
	- Air pollution
	- Invasive species
	- Wildfires
	- Insect outbreaks
	- Powerful personal imagery
	- Connects fragility of "health" with ecosystems
	- Misused and abused


Healthy or unhealthy:
Natural Forest:
- In Timber supply area...
	- Pest (unhealthy)
- In protected area...
	- natural disturbance (healthy)
- Intensively managed forest:
	- No pest impacts
	- Meets management objectives, but...
	- Limited in all aspects of ecological function

## Pathogens
- Can cause disturbances by disrupting tree physiological processes which can result in reduced growth or mortality
- They can attack tree roots, stems, branches, foliage, and the vascular system

### Dont always kill trees, they can also reduce tree growth
- Pathogens can reduce tree growth by reducing leaf area and decreasing photosynthesis
- Also steal resources from the host
- Cause tree deformities, which weakens host


## 50 WAYS TO KILL A TREE
- Disurpting water transport by blocking vascular system
- Kill roots and cause major structural damage
- Girdle stems, killing the living tissues of trees




# Forest Health: A Functional Definition
- Values create conflicts!
- Need a definition without human expectations:
A working definition:
- Forest ecosystems are healthy when their underlying ecological processes operate within a natural range of variability, so that on any temporal or spatial scale, they are dynamic and resilient* to disturbance

* If an ecosystem is resistant to disturbance and returns to a similar pre-disturbance state, it is considered resilient
