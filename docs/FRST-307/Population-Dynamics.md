Population dynamics = study of births, deaths, and the movement of organisms


- Critical to:
	- Characterization of populations
	- Prediction (spatial and temporal)
	- Management

Size of a population at any given time is determined by
- Natality (births = B)
- Mortality (Deaths = D)
- Immigration (I)
- Emigration (E)

Population Change = $B - D + I - E$

$N_{t+1} = N_{t} + (\Delta N)$


Rate of change:
Change = rate (deaths per number of individuals, births per female)
growth <u>rate</u> (r) = birth <u>rate</u> (b) - death <u>rate</u> (d) + immigration <u>rate</u> (i) - emmigration <u>rate</u> (e)
$r = (b-d+i-e)$

$\dfrac{dN}{dt} = rN$


Logistic growth:
Pop'ns cannot grow at an exponential rate indefinitely due to food/space limitations, or the action of natural enemies


$\dfrac{dN}{dt}=rN \dfrac{K-N}{K}$


- K is carrying capacity; the threshold at which population growth rate (r) is zero, negative above (i.e., the maximum sustainable population)
- As the number of individuals (N) in the pop'n increases, b, d, i, and e changes due to resource limitation, predation, etc.


## Factors affecting forest insect population size
<u>Mortality factors</u>
- climate and weather
- Food quantity/quality'Host susceptibility, habitat suitability
- Predation, parasitism, disease
- Intraspecific competition
- Interspecific competition
- Genetic defects


Density-independent factors
Definition: the proportionate effect on population processes (b, d, i ,e) is not related to population density.
