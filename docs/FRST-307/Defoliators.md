# Defoliators
## General Introduction
- 2nd in economic importance to bark beetles
- Many species of defoliators, few cause damage
- Defolitation is ubiquitous in forests -- always some level of injury
- Regulation of defoliator populations typically by natural enemies, seldom food limited
	- Predators
- Weather is extremely important as sa density-independent source of mortality


## Impacts
- Impacts / injury to individual trees
	- Feeding by larvae affects photosynthetic organs
	- Disruption of
		- Production
		- Transportation
		- Subsequent utilization of photosynthate

Reduced photosynthesis leads to:
1. general weakening
2. Growth loss (reduced ring increment)

General weakning and growth loss leads to:
- Increased susceptibility to secondary insects and/or infection:
	- Douglas-fir: beetle infestation
	- Spruce:
- Need more notes here from slides


Altered cone production:
- Light defoliation = increased cone production
	- Stress response
- Heavy defoliation = decreased cone production
	- Depleted reserves used for refoliation

Tree mortality:
- Death of parts of a tree
	- Preferential feeding on new foliage
		- Top kill
		- E.g. western spruce budworm
- Death of entire tree
	- Feeding on all foliage age classes
		- Douglas-fir tussock moth
		- Western hemlock tupper

## Tree Response
- Trees adapted to some level of defoliation (tolerance)
	- Excess foliage (more than required for optimal growth)
	- Energy reserves (stored photosynthate)
- Defence mechanisms to defoliation
	- Leaf toughness
	- Chemicals (constitutive and induced)
	- Hairs, thorns, etc. (trichomes)


Angiosperms are fairly tolerant
- photosynthate reserves
- Refoliation immediatelyh following defoliation
- Multiple years defoliation may deplete reserves
- Species differences
	- Aspen (tolerant) vs. maples (less tolerant)

Gymnosperms intolerant
- Large species differences
	- Photosynthate reserves:
		- Pines less than spruces
- Larch relatively tolerant



Defoliation impacts vary by timing and host tree species
- Early season worse than late; ew foliage worse than old (conifers)
- - Late season = shoot/leaf growth completed; photosynthate reserves established
- Old foliage = less efficient photosynthesis
	- Type of defoliation varies by insects: e.g. budworms (new foliage) vs sawflies (old foliage)

Impacts vary by host tree species


Old versus new foliage
- Old foliage at end of season or older cohorts (low importance to tree)
- New foliage, early season (highest importance to tree)
	- Significant loss of capacity for current & future photosynthate production/storage
		- E.g., spruce budworms -- early season defoliator, preference for new shoots
	- Relatively more new foliage in upper crown of conifers
		- Feeding concentrated in the upper crown; topkill
	- Conditions in upper crown promote injury
		- Sun leaves more nutritious than shade leaves
		- More heat accumulation in upper crown
- Insect preference a guide for impact


Suppressed trees on poor sites
- more likely to suffer
- Crown closure and stand structure affect tolerance
	- Open grown white pine
		  75-100% defoliation = death
	- Shaded white pine
		- 25-50% defoliation = death
	- Poor crown on understory trees
		- Relatively less foliage
			- Fewer insects = growth loss/mortality


## Environmental influences
- Synchronization (i.e. phenology) critical to many defoliators
	- Egg hatch/emergence synchronized to bud burst
		- Determined by "degree-day" accumulation (temperature)
			- Threshold temperature above which development begins
	- Spruce bud moth
		- White spruce buds suitable for colonization less than 1 week
	- Douglas-fir tussock moth
		- Hatch only following 77-97% bud burst


New foliage, why the preference?
- Not as tough
- More nutritious
- But, very ephemeral (available for only a very limited time)

Phenological constraints: Early season defoliator adaptations to access new foliage
- Synchronize feeding stages with bud burst
	- Egg hatch
		- Douglas fir tussock moth
	- Larval emergences
		- Spruce budworms
	- Or utilize older foliage
		- Conifer sawflies
	- Poor synchrony = larval starvation
	- Phenological adaptations by trees to avoid defoliation
		- E.g., black spruce
			- Late bud break
			- 10-14 days later than white spruce and balsam
			- "Immune" to spruce budworm
