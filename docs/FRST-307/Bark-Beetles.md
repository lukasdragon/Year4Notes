## Bark Beetles
(Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae)
Feed within subcortical tissues (e.g. phloem) of virtually all parts of woody and herbaceous plants
- Roots
- Stems/boles
- Branches/twigs
- Fruits/cones

Generally mono- to oligophagous
- They only like one (mono) to a few species (oligophagous)

Most commonly associated with conifers as disturbance agents
- High diversity in conifer ecosystems

## Roles and impacts
Consumption of phloem tissue kills part or all of a tree

Ecological roles:
	- Succession
		- Species removal
	- Soil nutrient cycles
		- Decay processes (e.g. fungi)
	- Fire cycles
		- Ecosystem renewal

Socio-economic impacts:
- Production forestry
	- Decaying dead trees non-merchantable
- Aesthetics
	- Loss of high-value trees on private lands
- Wildland-urban interface
	- Fuel loading, fire risk
	- Tree failure
- Biodiversity/endangered species
	- Ecosystem alterations
- Water quantity/quality
	- Watershed alteration
- Carbon dynamics
	- CO2 release from dead organic matter


## General Biology
### Brood production
- Mating
- Gallery construction
- Oviposition
- Brood Development


Males or females initiate attacks (species dependent)
Male initiators = males excavate nuptial gallery for mating
- Multiple females (polygamous)
- Egg galleries (one per female) extend from nuptial chambers

Female initiators = mating at bark surface
- Most species +/- monogamous
- Females create single egg gallery

Gallery patterns (with host-tree identification) often characteristic of species



#### Gallery creation versus tunneling/scoring
- Galleries are created by multiple, related individuals (offspring/sibling) whereas tunnels are created by one individual


Females:
- Lay eggs singly or in groups in niches along margins of gallery
- Niches packed with frass
- Fecundity from several to 300 eggs/females

Males
- Frequently assist females by cleaning galleries
- Adaptations for clearing frass/boring dust:
	- Elytral declivity, flattened head capsule, hairiness


#### Brood production 3
- Larvae feed and develop through several [[FRST-307/instars]]
- Pupation occurs in enlarged chambers at the end of larval galleries or in common feeding area
- Young (i.e. tuneral) adults often feed to complete maturation (increase flight muscles, acquire symbionts, sclerotize)
- Mature adults cut exit hole to outside
- Maturation feeding may involve other plant parts (e.g. European elm bark beetle)

[[FRST-307/Sceloritization]]


#### Brood production 4
- The number of generations per year (i.e. voltinism) may be less than 1 (semivoltine) to 7-8 (multivoltine)
- One generation per year (univoltine) most common in Canada


#### Brood Production 5
Temperature is very important (based on elevation or latitude or both)

- Within a species, the number of generations per year may vary with climatic conditions
- Climate-related population asynchrony may cause significant mortality
	- Delayed/advanced development cause cold susceptible stages to overwinter
	- Prolonged adult emergence reduces chances of mating


## Emergence/dispersal
- Flight
- Host selection
- Environmental impacts
	- Temp, humidity, light


- Optimal temperature and humidity required for emergence and flight
- Avoid rain and winds > maximum flight speed
- Short window of emergence to maximize chances of finding mates/hosts


- Flight period may be required before beetles become receptive to cues from hosts or conspecifics (other beetles)
	- Ensures population dispersal, minimizes intraspecific competition.

- Dispersal both short and long range
- Most beetles fly beneath canopy (short-range dispersal, upwind flight when seeking hosts or mates)
- Small percentage fly above canopy (long-range dispersal)


Host selection (primary attraction)
- Cues
	- Light/temperature (stand density)
	- Visual (large vertical silhouettes)
	- Olfactory (e.g. ethanol, terpenes)
- Cascade of decisions:
1. Host versus non-host species
2. Susceptible versus resistant
3. High versus low quality
4. Presence/absence of competitor species
5. Presence/absence of conspecifics


## Colonization
- Beetle-tree interactions
- Mortality factors
	- Tree defense
	- Competition
	- Predation

- Host acceptance based on gustatory stimulation (i.e. taste)
- Following acceptance (by pioneer beetles)
	- Release of aggregation pheromones (both sexes)
	- Response by conspecifics (secondary attraction)



Trees produce resin as defense against attacks
- Most bark beetles select trees with impaired defenses
	- Drought, disease, windthrow, suppression, age
	- "secondary species"
- Some species don't care
	- "primary species"

Primary beetles:
- Preferentially attack large diameter vigorous trees
- Succesful attack requires tree mortality
- Occasionally undergo population eruoptions (i.e. outbreaks) and cause mortality over landscapes

Secondary:
- Preferentially attack suppressed trees


Tree defenses
- succesful colonization contingent on tree death
	- Trees have evolved defensive responses
	- Constitutive resinosus
		- Preformed resin ducts or pockets exude pitch
		- Mainly physical barrier
	- Induced resinosus
		- Cellular necrosis (autolysis) and release of toxins
	- Defense = vigour
