- Stand dynamics describe the processes of change over time in forest stand structure, including the disturbance (start and end).

For example:
Forest burns down -> regeneration -> phase where the forest density increases -> old growth


Terms:
- Growing space
	- The space which each plant has available to develop to grow
	- Not only resources (light, water, nutrients), but also physical space
	- Sum of all resources available to an individual tree (the local environment)
- Age class
	- A distinct group of trees or portion of the stand categorized on the basis of chronological age
		- Important stand types defined based on age class:
			- Even-aged: One age class
			- Two-aged: Two age classes
			- Uneven-aged: Three or more age classes
	- Fieldwork typically uses codes
- Cohort
	- An aggregation of trees that have established due to the same disturbance
	- Distinction between age class and cohortL
		- Cohort can include advance regeneration that was present in the understory before the disturbance, so the chronological age of cohorts can vary widely
- Crown class:
	- Describes the relative size and position of a tree's crown within the canopy of a stand
		1. Dominant (D): Large crowns above the rest
		2. Co-Dominant (C): Large crowns but not the tallet; Have a steeper angle getting light
		3. Intermediate (I): Still get direct light from above, very narrow crowns; very squished between Dominant and Co-Dominant
		4. Opressed (O) (Suppressed): Very little light; on their way out

- Stratification:
	- Different species develop complex multi-species and uneven-aged stands seperated into different strata.


Disturbances are the driver of natural stand dynamics:
- Both the end and the beginning
- Drivers of natural stand dynamics

What matters most in BC?
- Fire
- Wind
- Insects



Disturbance Regime:
- Describes the temporal and spatial characteristics of a disturbance agent, and its impact on the landscape.
	- Temporal Characteristics
	- Spatial
	- Impact
- Frequency of stand-initiating events varies with ecosystem type
- Return interval is key to stand development and landscape level heterogeneity




Stand Initiation
* Growing space is available
* Early pioneer species dominate
* Trees establish until all growing space is occupied


Stem Exclusion
- All growing space is in use
- Competition among trees
- No regeneration
- Branch mortality - Living crown moves up
- Number of trees declines due to mortality

Understory re-initiation
- Overstory is less dense
- Self-thinning occurs
- Growing space becomes slowly available
- Shade tolerant species regenerate and form a new understory


Old Growth:
- Trees can grow large
- Over time, trees in the overstory die and are replaced
- Gap phase:
	- Mortality of old trees creates space for regeneration
- Pioneer species are rare


Consequences for silviculture
* Silviculture practice aims at imitating natural disturbances
	* Important for biodiversity and habitat quality
	* Natural stand dynamics automate processes with desirable outcomes, for example:
		* Branch mortality
		* Increased diversity and flexibility through stratification
* Knowledge about how tree species can make use of the growing space is key
	* Silvics
	* Competitiveness
	* Facilitation


Key Takeaways:
* Stand dynamics depend on the ecosystem with its species and disturbance regime
* Over the long term, structurally rich, uneven-aged stands form when disturbance is rare
* Disturbance regimes differ strongly across ecosystems
* Trees compete for growing space
* Knowledge about successional stage is key for developing silvicultural prescriptions that utilize natural processes for your objectives
