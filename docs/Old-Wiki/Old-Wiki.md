Welcome

Welcome to the course directory for the Study Gang Wiki! We are a small
community of forestry students looking to collaboratively contribute to
high-quality course notes. If you have any questions, please direct them
to "olson\@student.ubc.ca"!

Here are a few gentle reminders for how to use this wiki:

-   Please do not upload course contents as this would violate copyright
    law. Rather, please summarize notes in your own words. Please cite
    if you are directly referring to a resource.
-   Please do not use this wiki as a citable resource in any assignment
    in existence, as this would violate copyright law. Rather, please
    use this wiki as a way to solidify your understanding of course
    materials.
-   Please do not share this wiki readily with everyone that you know.
    Rather, please share this wiki with peers who will: 1) absolutely
    benefit from the materials in this wiki, and 2) absolutely follow
    these guidelines provided here.
