This is a section for UFOR 316.

Here are some tips for doing well in this course, based upon a friendly
peer's observation and experience:Â 

1.  Fill in the tree info datasheets early!! Do not wait until the last
    few days to fill and print. You may face one of the following: 1)
    was unable to fill them all in time, or 2) the printer fails in some
    way.
2.  Choose your trees outside of campus, and take photos for the final
    project early (September - October). When it comes to November and
    December, all the foliage is gone, which might not be in your
    favour.
3.  Attend the tree walk. The tree walk will help you get to know the
    species in person. Try to come on time.
