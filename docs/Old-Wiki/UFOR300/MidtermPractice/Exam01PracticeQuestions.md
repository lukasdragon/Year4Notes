You have two soils, a sandy soil and a clayey soil. Which soil do you
expect will have a greater change in soil strength over a range of soil
moisture contents? 

1.  the clayey soil
2.  the sandy soil
3.  they will have the same change in soil strength
4.  soil strength is a fundamental quality in soils and does not change

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You planted a Southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) tree in honor of
your parents 5 years ago and it is doing well and is now 8 cm dbh.
However, there is a severe summer drought and you would like to water
the entire root system once a week to make sure it thrives. How far out
from the trunk do you estimate the root system extends so you can
position your drip irrigation line accordingly? Explain your reasoning,
draw a picture if helpful. 

8 cm X 38 cm = 304 cm diameter of root system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compared to spring-transplanted trees, fall-transplanted plants will
likely... 

1.  initiate root growth earlier in the spring
2.  require more frequent irrigation
3.  have a coarser root system
4.  have less root turnover

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pavement placed around trees will likely.... 

1.  result in more roots near the soil surface
2.  allow more rapid water infiltration
3.  result in more fine root production and fewer structural roots
4.  encourage the formation of tap roots to access the water table

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adding crushed limestone to soil tends to... 

1.  raise pH
2.  lower pH
3.  increase soil compaction
4.  enhance salt tolerance

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In its natural setting baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) is found in
swamps, sometimes in standing water. It competes well in this
environment because it tolerates standing water and does not tolerate
fire. However it is also grows successfully when planted in upland urban
sites, including in tree pits in urban centers far outside its native
range. This tolerance for a broad range of soil moisture conditions is
indicative of this tree's

1.  fundamental niche
2.  native range
3.  realized niche
4.  excellent stomatal control

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are assessing the health of a large tree and after making your
assessment you notice several large conks (mushroom growths) 2 to 3 m up
the trunk that you hadn't spotted earlier. You...

1.  Downgrade your condition rating
2.  Disregard these, most conks are ephemeral
3.  Consider it can probably be disregarded, but break off a piece of
    conk to see if it is still alive to confirm
4.  Upgrade your condition rating

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are doing a condition assessment of a 24 cm trunk diameter deciduous
hardwood tree, Acer saccharum (sugar maple), in the winter in Toronto. 
You notice that it has retained almost all its leaves, even at the end
of its branches. They are brown and shriveled but still hanging from the
branches. What does this tell you about the condition of the tree? 

Some kind of vascular wilt has infliction upon the tree. Persistence of
leaves in the winter in Toronto is a bad sign for many trees. The tree's
condition is shit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If newer leaves on a plant are yellowing, this may be a symptom of... 

1.  Fe excess
2.  Ca deficiency
3.  Fe or Mg deficiency
4.  N deficiency

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following usually indicates tree stress? 

1.  The absence of fruit
2.  The absence of lichen on the bark
3.  The absence of mature foliage (as opposed to juvenile)
4.  Early fall coloration for that species.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are various protocols for assigning condition ratings to trees
that are maintained by various organizations for various purposes. All
of the entities below will have condition rating systems of sorts. Which
is most likely to be used in legal disputes about individual trees (for
example, if a property  owner cuts down her neighbor's tree)? The
protocol from... 

1.  i-Tree Eco
2.  An individual consulting company (their proprietary protocol)
3.  The Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers
4.  The Urban Foresty Inventory and Analysis (from the US Forest
    Service)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Does a tree condition assessment also include a tree risk assessment?
(Yes or No) 

No

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When two co-dominant stems expand in diameter so they are pressed
tightly together you are likely to find
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_in between
these stems. The presence of this is considered a point of structural
weakness.

Describe a situation where the Canadian Hardiness Zone system would be
useful to you as an urban forester? 

Species selection

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Describe a microclimate that could be created by the built environment.
Give an example of how this microclimate might affect trees? (short
answer) 

A plant placed next to a building and other concrete, solar radiation is
absorbed by the concrete during the day. At night, long-wave radiation
is slowly released keeping temperatures elevated all night long. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between a cultivar and a registered trademark?
(short answer)

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Platanus x hispanica (London plane) is native to environments with
plentiful water. Therefore, this species has not developed strong
stomatal control mechanisms (when soil is dry, stomata may not close
quickly). Instead, they survive dry periods by shedding leaves. This is
an example of a(n)...

1.  phenological adaptation
2.  xerophytic strategy
3.  instance of competitive exclusion
4.  plant biome

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Describe two mechanisms by which turfgrass, such as tall fescue can
inhibit the growth of nearby trees. Use specific terminology. 

1.  Allelopathy
2.  Mutualistic Bacterium

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In comparison to other production systems, container-grown trees are
LESS likely to.... 

1.  have girdling roots
2.  be whippy (have reduced trunk taper)
3.  meet the Canadian Standard for Nursery Stock
4.  produced in colder climates

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are selecting trees to plant in the median in Wesbrook Mall (the
strip of land in the middle of the street). It has already been decided
that you will plant Ulmus americana 'Princeton' . What size and
production system will you specify? Be specific (give exact size, for
example). Justify your answer.
