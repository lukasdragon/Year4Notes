**Rules should be applied from #1 - #6; E.g., #1 takes precedence over #6**

1. No toxicity
2. The Golden Rule: Treat others as you would like to be treated and love thine neighbors as you love yourself
	- It is human nature to give unto others as they give unto you; Therefore, if you're sarcastic with someone, it's fair if they're sarcastic back to you -- so long as it is with good intentions.
3. I expect group members to be understanding with each other, with the teaching team, and with themselves
4. I expect all group members to provide the same level of organization in their work as the teaching team provides to the students.
	- Unless written otherwise on the Canvas page, due dates and deliverables are negotiable and verbal. 
	- While students should do their best to keep track of individual assignments, like real office work, due dates should be clearly outlined with clear expectations by "the boss or client" (teaching team).
5. I expect adequate feedback from the teaching team to understand where I am excelling and where I need improvement
6. Embrace our strengths to lessen our weaknesses; Embrace our weakness to build our strengths : As a diverse class and as groups with diverse members, we all have our strengths and weaknesses. The strong should help support the weak, and the weak should embrace the strong. The weak can help optimize processes by sharing their confusions as it is often in confusions that inefficiencies are unveiled.
7. I am committed to work 3 hours per week outside of class
8. I aspire to do <u>stuff</u>
